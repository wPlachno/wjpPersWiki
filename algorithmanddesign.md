# Algorithms and Design

[Data Structures](datastructure.md) are common ways of containing data, usually in memory, including stacks, trees, and linked lists.

[Design Patterns](designpattern.md) are common solutions created to solve common problems, like factories.

[Procedural Generation Algorithms](procgenalg.md) are the algorithms used for procedural generation. These are the algorithms that produce the terrain in Minecraft and other generative games.
