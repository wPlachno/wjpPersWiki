# OtterWiki

## What is it?

OtterWiki is a collaborative content manager, or wiki, written in python, with git repository support. For official documentation, [see the Github repo](https://github.com/redimp/otterwiki).

## Experience

Will first looked into this platform when considering using the Raspberry Pi to serve a personal wiki. Unfortunately, this solution was abandoned in favor of hosting on GitHub Pages, and reserving the Raspberry Pi for other projects.
