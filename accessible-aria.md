# ARIA and Accessibility

Accessible Rich Internet Applications, or ARIA, are a system of [roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) and [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes) that can be used on web content to provide tools for users with disabilities. 

Please follow [best practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) when thinking of ARIA.
