# Procedural Generation Algorithms

## Map Generation

Many algorithms can be used to generate 2d or 3d grids, most of which can be found on the [Procedural Generation Wiki](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm%3amap-generation).

For a full generation overview, see [Amit's Polygon Map Generation](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/).
