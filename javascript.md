# Javascript

Originally just used for simple scripting on html pages, Javascript has grown in usability and has been ported over to be used as a backend instead of just frontend.

[GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is a graphing solution I originally found in [HaydenLeBaron's Wiki Visualizer](https://github.com/HaydenLeBaron/mdwiki-cartographer). It seems to be more portable than I originally thought. I want to get more comfortable using this. 

For something much more straightforward, there is the [FlotChart System](http://www.flotcharts.org/), which uses jquery and provides a plotting tool.

Even more basic, [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) provides a simple svg library for printing to the browser, though I am currently unsure what here is not already implemented naturally.

Microsoft has their "Microsoft 365" platform, connecting users' Calendars, OneNote, OneDrive and others in a safe, easy way. The [Microsoft Graph API](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) is the best way to access all this information.
