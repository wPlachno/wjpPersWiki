# The Wiki Project

Started 11/1/23, this project concerns my ongoing need for a personal Content Management Solution, or a personal wiki. While this wiki is being used temporarily, I hope to write my own CMS that satisfies my requirements.

## History

Initially, I was hoping to set up [OtterWiki](otterwiki.md) on my [Raspberry Pi](raspberrypi.md) using the [Docker Image](docker.md), but due to the 32-bit architecture of the Pi, I hit a segmentation fault early on in the process. 

I then [attempted to try installing](wikijsinstallation.md) [Wiki JS](wikijs.md), but hit a similar issue.

Eventually, I decided to put the Pi to the side and host [MDWiki](mdwiki.md) on Github Pages, where I was able to [really brainstorm](generalwikinotes.md) about what I needed.
