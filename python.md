# Python

## Common Imports

In Python, you need to import libraries you need. You do so by sticking a line near the top of the script saying `import LIBRARY_NAME`.

**sys**: You can use sys.argv[] to check command line arguments.

**Print to User**: `print ("Text")`
**Input from User**: `input ("Please enter text: ")`
**Comments**: ` # Comment `
**If**:
``` Python
if a == b:
	# a = b
elif a < b:
	# a < b
else:
	# a > b 
# Afterwards...
```
**While**:
``` Python
while a < b:
	# loopy
else: 
	# once loop ends
# After else
```
**For**:
``` Python
for i in range(1,5,2): 
	# i = [1,3], range(i^0=1, i<5, i=i+2)
else:
	# Immediately after loop
```

[A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) is a free internet book that serves as an introduction to Python. 

[GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is an open-source graphing solution I originally found in [HaydenLeBaron's Wiki Visualizer](https://github.com/HaydenLeBaron/mdwiki-cartographer). It seems to be more portable than I originally thought. I want to get more comfortable using this. The python library [graphviz](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) implements the larger library in this language.
