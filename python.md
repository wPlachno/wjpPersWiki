[GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is an open-source graphing solution I originally found in [HaydenLeBaron's Wiki Visualizer](https://github.com/HaydenLeBaron/mdwiki-cartographer). It seems to be more portable than I originally thought. I want to get more comfortable using this. The python library [graphviz](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) implements the larger library in this language.
