# Hypertext Markup Language

Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is one of the three core pieces of web pages. HTML defines what is on the page, CSS defines how things look, and Javascript is the logic of how they work.

When developing HTML, please consider [accessibility](accessible-aria.md).

## HTML Edits by Libraries

If you see HTML attributes like `x-data`, `x-text`, or `x-model`, you may be looking at [Alpine JS](alpinejs.md).

If the class attribute has a lot of classes, you are probably looking at some form of Atomic CSS, possibly [Bootstrap](bootstrap.md) or [Tailwind](tailwindcss.md).
