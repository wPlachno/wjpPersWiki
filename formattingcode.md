# Formatting Code

Every company has their own unique culture, and that culture includes a specific way of formatting code. While many of these are also defined by the language and stack, there are some global ideas as well.

## Variable Naming

Different languages have different best practices regarding how to name your variables, but there are [names for the formats](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/).

| Type | Example | Languages | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camel Case | exampleClassName | Java, Kotlin |
| Pascal Case | ExampleClassName | Pascal |
| Kebab Case | example-class-name | Inner Bootstrap |
| Snake Case | example_class_name | Python |

For my personal style, I use them like this:

| Type | Use-Cases |
| --- | --- |
| camelCase | Variables and functions, properties and attributes |
| PascalCase | Classes and interfaces, structs and namespaces |
| kebab-case | Web Data only, including URLs |
| snake_case | Consts and Globals, SQL |
