# Eleventy (11ty)

*Eleventy* is a node-based static site generator, where you can feed it many different types of files and it converts them into html that you can put to be statically served from a web server.

## Use Case

While every situation is different, 11ty is a valuable tool for if a client wants to set up a static page. If they don't need any flashy server communication, which can be done but is not recommended, then 11ty is the best platform to use. With the support for many templating engines, you can have a default site that you copy and paste, then change the variables you need, and set the content accordingly. Theoretically, you can also use your own templates to store web components.
