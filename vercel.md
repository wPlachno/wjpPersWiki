# Vercel

Vercel is a developer-experience oriented platform for deploying a [server-less](serverless.md) front-end. With headless or Jamstack applications, the front-end is kept separate from the back-end. 

## What It Does

The Vercel platform tracks a repository and... well, "Vercel has taken that code of mine, put it on servers around the world, put a URL in front of it, and optimized it to run and load fast." - [Justin Gage, founder of Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/what-is-vercel). 

Further, Vercel provides a dashboard for maintaining your deployment, including deployment status, recent deployments, domains, server logs, analytics, and a command-line interface.

Also supplied is a test deployment for branches with a pull request. The Vercel platform also integrates next.js to your deployment and provides [edge functionality](web-the-edge.md), including file uploads, databases, and visual editing. 

### Summary

The Vercel platform hosts a serverless front end with a full diagnostic suite, and provides edge functionality and serverless functions.

## NextJS

Vercel, as a company, is also the developers and maintainers of [Next.js](nextjs.md), a popular open-source [web framework](web-framework.md) for React.
