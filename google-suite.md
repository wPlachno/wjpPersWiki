# Google Suite

## Google Docs

Think Microsoft Word, but with multiple people editing documents.

## Google Sheets

Think Microsoft Excel, but with multiple people editing documents, and less extensible. Can also auto hook up to Google Forms. There are many [built-in functions](google-sheets-functions.md) you can use, and you can also [extend it with Google Scripts](google-sheets-scripting.md), but for many use-cases, [the graphical functionality](using-google-sheets.md) is sufficient.

## Google Forms

A nice way to do a simple form that you can have dump the info into a spreadsheet.
