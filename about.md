# About This Project

As we grow older, our memory deteriorates. Many find that the solution is to write down as much as possible. This project is a personal wiki for Will Plachno - a place to put knowledge that he does not want to lose!

# About Will Plachno

Will is a software engineer looking to build his resume while he tries to find his first job out of college. 

In December 2022, Will graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science, but it took a while to get there. During schooling, Will had several professional endeavors, including the [interface of elqc.com](http://www.elqc.com), training the owner of [lovetessajoy.com](http://www.lovetessajoy.com) how to use WordPress, and interning at [Kaseya Remote IT Management Solutions] (https://www.kaseya.com/). Will also had several hobby projects, including a dashboard for displaying Aspects for the TTRPG Fate, a database for tracking collection completion in Forza Horizon 4, a database clone to pull down online info for Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition, and many more. 

As you can tell from the existence of this wiki, Will is constantly trying to evolve and learn new things, so feel free to send him an [e-mail](email:wjplachno@gmail.com).
