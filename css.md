# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a tool supported in all modern browsers as a core piece of displaying the web page: HTML describes the structure, Javascript describes the logic, and CSS describes the presentation. 

## Libraries

[Bootstrap](bootstrap.md) is a library using CSS and JS that normalizes the look of a site across browsers, simplifies responsiveness, and adds several useful components

[Tailwind](tailwindcss.md) is a library that allows you to move the css of an element into the html class attribute, increasing clutter on the html side for a net gain on ease of development and maintenance.
