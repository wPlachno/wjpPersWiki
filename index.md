# Welcome to Will Plachno's Personal Wiki

Right now, this is a self-driven project to create a Github hosted personal wiki using [MDWiki](mdwiki.md) and [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet.md). For more information, see the [about page](about.md).

## Personnel

Articles about people. Currently, the only personnel article is [the author's resume](wpresume.md).
