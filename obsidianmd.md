# Obsidian MD

Obsidian MD is a personal knowledge platform that has gained wide usage in the early 2020's due to its core usage of markdown files mixed with many useful plugins and synching ability across multiple platforms.

## Plugins

Obsidian without plugins is much like this site: a wiki with internal linking, though you can also give your wiki some structure with folder heirarchies. 

With plugins, the usefulness of the platform skyrockets.

There are generally two types of plugins for obsidian: official plugins, which come built-in or can be enabled with a simple switch, and community plugins, designed by users of the platforms.

### Calendar

While obsidian md has no built-in calendar functionality, this plugin does more than just give you a date picker. You can see a calendar view that you can use to track all sorts of information.

### Templaters

Obsidian does come with a simple built-in templating plugin, but this is a community plugin that extends the functionality to the point of being able to write Javascript in Obsidian.
