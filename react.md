# React

## Libraries

For a library of components, check out [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), literally a copy-paste library of react components, including accordions, smart-positioning checkboxes, context-menu (right-click) customization, pop-overs (think modeless dialogs), drop-downs, even [placeholders for loading content](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/skeleton).

You can use [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev/) to use AI to generate UI.
